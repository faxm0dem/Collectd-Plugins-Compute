Collectd-Plugins-Compute

This is an attempt to implement the "compute" plugin in perl.
It permits to do calculations on other plugins currently in collectd's cache.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to access the latter using the perl plugin, so there are two
possibilities:

 - register a write callback
 - use unixsock

The first solution has the drawback of being extremely uneffective, especially on systems
with many values, as your plugin has to do the mix and matching throughout the whole
ecosystem of values. The second has the drawback to rely on the unixsock plugin, which in turn needs to be loaded before the compute plugin, which can currently only be achieved reliably
using two separate collectd instances. The second approach has been chosen here.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

USAGE

The configuration is best explained in an example:

 LoadPlugin perl
 <Plugin perl>
   BaseName "Collectd::Plugins"
   LoadPlugin Compute
   <Plugin Compute>
     UnixSock "/var/run/collectd-unixsock"
     <Target>
       <tgt_memused>
			   host "target1host.example.com"
			   plugin "memory"
			   type "memory"
			   type_instance "used"
			 </tgt_memused>
			 <tgt_memfree>
			   host "target1host.example.com"
			   plugin "memory"
			   type "memory"
			   type_instance "free"
			 </tgt_memfree>
		 </Target>
		 <Compute>
			 RPN "tgt_memused" "tgt_memfree" "/" 100 "*"
			 SetHost "somehost.example.com"
			 SetPlugin "memory_ratio"
			 SetType "percent"
			 SetTypeInstance "used_vs_free"
		 </Compute>
	  </Plugin>
 </Plugin>

This example will yield a new value whose identifier will be "somehost.example.com/memory_ratio/percent-used_vs_free". "Target" blocks must contain fully qualified plugin names, e.g. must match exactly one plugin in the cache, and will be used inside "Compute" blocks by their name, to compute the reverse polish notation "RPN" blocks.
There can be as many "Compute" blocks as needed.
