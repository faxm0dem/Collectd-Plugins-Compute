Collectd-Plugins-Compute

This is an attempt to implement the "compute" plugin in perl.
It permits to do calculations on other plugins currently in collectd's cache.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to access the latter using the perl plugin, so there are two
possibilities:

 - register a write callback
 - use unixsock

The first solution has the drawback of being extremely uneffective, especially on systems
with many values, as your plugin has to do the mix and matching throughout the whole
ecosystem of values. The second has the drawback to rely on the unixsock plugin, which in turn needs to be loaded before the compute plugin, which can currently only be achieved reliably
using two separate collectd instances. The second approach has been chosen here.
